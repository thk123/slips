A tool to help novice and young Python developers fix common errors in their code. 

Often the errors from the Python interpreter can be hard to determine what has gone wrong in the code. This tool will attempt to spot these common errors and provide a plain English explanation of what is wrong.

It will attempt to spot:

 - Typos in variable names
 - Missing colons
 - Missing brackets 
 - Unexpected indentation
 - Single equals in boolean condition
